#Contributing

Your contributions are welcome, encouraged, and needed.

This is not an official project of Tenon, but rather just a sample for use by our user community. It is unlikely we'll maintain it ourselves. We do, however,
welcome contributions by the broad user community.  Here are some general guidelines for contributing:

* Fork the repo and work against your fork.
* When ready, issue a pull request
* New pull requests must have a related [issue](https://bitbucket.org/tenon-io/sample-php-class/issues). Describe specifically what is needed and why. (Hint, it might be cool to look in the issues list to see if there's already an issue open for the feature you're interested in)
* Issue your pull request against that specific issue. In your pull request, describe change(s), including what it is intended to demonstrate.
